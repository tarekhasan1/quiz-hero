          2. What is the difference between local storage, session storage and
          cookies?
        </h2>
        <p class="mt-5">
          There are three mechanism for storing data on the client in
          javascript, they are-<br />
          <span>local storage</span>, <br />
          <span>session storage</span> and<br />
          <span>cookies</span>. <br />
          <br />
          <span class="font-semibold">local storage</span> allows for larger
          amounts of data to be stored, but the data is not deleted when the
          browser is closed. Local storage is useful for storing data that the
          user will need to access later, such as offline data. <br />
          <br />
          <span class="font-semibold">session storage</span> is similar to
          cookies, but the data is only stored for the current session. This
          means that the data will be deleted when the user closes the browser.
          Session storage is useful for storing data that is sensitive, such as
          login credentials. <br />
          <br />
          <span class="font-semibold">cookies</span> are the oldest and most
          well-known mechanism. They are simple to use and well supported by
          browsers. However, they are limited to 4KB of data and are often used
          to store data that is not sensitive, such as user preferences.

          3. What is event loop and how it works?
        </h2>
        <p class="mt-5">
          A mechanism used to manage asynchronous code execution is known as
          event loop. <br />
          <br />
          <span class="font-semibold">working principle:</span>The event loop
          always checks the call stack and the task queue to ensure that tasks
          are executed in the correct order. <br />
          <span class="italic">working steps of event loop- </span>
          The call stack is a data structure used to keep track of function
          calls. When a function is called, it is added to the top of the call
          checks the call stack and the task queue. If the call stack is empty,
          it takes the first task from the task queue and adds it to the call
          stack. When the task is executed, it may queue up additional tasks to
          be executed later. These tasks are added to the end of the task queue.
          The event loop repeats this process, continuously checking the call
          stack and the task queue, and executing tasks as they become
          available.

          4. What is the purpose of quizTimer function?
        </h2>
        <p class="mt-5">
          when the quizTimer function is called without passing any truthy
          value then this function will repeatedly call the setInterval method
          after one second until quizTimer function is called by passing
          any truthy value.
