          2. What is the difference between local storage, session storage and
          cookies?
        </h2>
        <p class="mt-5">
            There are three mechanism for storing data on the client in javascript, they are-<br>
            <span>local storage</span>, <br>
            <span>session storage</span> and<br>
            <span>cookies</span>. <br>
            <br />
            <span class="font-semibold">local storage</span> allows for larger amounts of data to be stored, but the
            data is not deleted when the browser is closed. Local
            storage is useful for storing data that the user will need
            to access later, such as offline data. <br />
            <br />
            <span class="font-semibold">session storage</span> is similar to cookies, but
            the data is only stored for the current session. This means
            that the data will be deleted when the user closes the
            browser. Session storage is useful for storing data that is
            sensitive, such as login credentials. <br />
            <br />
            <span class="font-semibold">cookies</span> are the oldest and most well-known
            mechanism. They are simple to use and well supported by
            browsers. However, they are limited to 4KB of data and are
            often used to store data that is not sensitive, such as user
            preferences.
